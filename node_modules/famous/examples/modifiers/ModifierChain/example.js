/**
 * ModifierChain
 * -------------
 * 
 * ModifierChain is a class to add and remove a chain of modifiers
 * at a single point in the render tree.  Because it add exists 
 * in a single element, it has slight performance benefits over 
 * chaining individual modifiers.
 *
 * In the example, you can see that on the click event we are able
 * to remove a modifier after it has been added to the render tree.
