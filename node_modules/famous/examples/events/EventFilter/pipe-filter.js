/**
 * EventFilter with piping
 * -----------------------
 *
 * EventFilter provides a way to define a function that 
 * can decide whether or not to propogate events downwards.
 *
 * In this example, we pipe all events from eventHandlerA to
 * the EventFilter.  This filter will only propogate events
 * if the data's 'msg' property is 'ALERT!'.  Because we change
 * the msg that is broadcast every click, you can see that the
 * alert occurs every other click.
