/**
 * EventMapper
 * ------------
 *
 * EventMapper is a way to route events to various EventHandlers
 * based on the type of the event.
 *
 * In this example, we pipe all events from eventHandlerA to
 * the EventMapper.  This filter will decide whether to send
 * the event to eventHandlerB or eventHandlerC based on the
 * direction property of the data sent along with the event.
