/**
 * SpringTransition
 * --------
 *
 * SpringTransition is a method of transitioning between two values (numbers,
 * or arrays of numbers) with a bounce. The transition will overshoot the target
 * state depending on the parameters of the transition.
 *
 * In this example, there is a surface attached to a SpringTransition.
