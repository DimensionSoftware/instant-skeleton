/**
 * GridLayout with sized modifier
 * ------------------------------
 * 
 * GridLayouts will respect their parents size.  When placed behind
 * a modifier with a set size, the layout will expand to that size
 * instead of filling the full window.
 *
 * In this example, we see a GridLayout behind a sized Modifier.
