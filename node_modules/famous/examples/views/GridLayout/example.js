/**
 * GridLayout
 * -------------
 * 
 * GridLayout is a layout which divides a context into several evenly-sized grid cells.
 * If dimensions are provided, the grid is evenly subdivided with children
 * cells representing their own context, otherwise the cellSize property is used to compute 
 * dimensions so that items of cellSize will fit.
 *
 * In this example, we make a 4x2 grid with 8 surfaces with varying hues.
