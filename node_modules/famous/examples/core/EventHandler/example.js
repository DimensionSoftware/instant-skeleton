/**
 * EventHandler
 * ------------
 *
 * EventHandler is a way to broadcast and listen to events.
 *
 * In this example, we pipe the DOM events of the surface to the
 * EventHandler.  When we then click the surface, the event handler
 * receives that event and calls all of the listeners of the "click"
 * event.
