/**
 * EventHandler triggering
 * -----------------------
 *
 * This example shows the most basic functionality of EventHandler.
 * First, we register a function to be run on the "click" event.
 * When the event handler gets the surface click, we trigger "triggeredEvent",
 * which will call all of the register listeners resulting in the alert.
 *
