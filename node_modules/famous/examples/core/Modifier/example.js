/**
 * Modifier
 * --------
 *
 * Modifiers are Famo.us nodes that can be added to the render tree which affect
 * the appearance of the nodes below. Modifiers can apply a CSS3 3D
 * transform (translation, rotation, scale or skew), or an opacity. Modifiers also
 * affect layout primitives by defining a size context (bounding box) and origin.
 *
 * In this example, we can see that the surface is translated 50
 * pixels right and 50 pixels down because it sits below the
 * modifier in the render tree.
