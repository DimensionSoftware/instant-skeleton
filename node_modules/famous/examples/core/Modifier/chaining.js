/**
 * Modifier chaining
 * ------------------
 *
 * When you chain modifiers all of them will be applied to 
 * any children in the render tree.  The order in which you add
 * the modifiers matters.  Translating and then rotating is not the same as
 * rotating and then translating.
 *
 * In this example, we can see that the two surfaces are laid out
 * differently because one has its translation happen before its rotation,
 * and the reverse is true for the other.
