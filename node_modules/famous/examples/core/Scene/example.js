/**
 * Scene
 * --------
 *
 * Scene is a way of defining a complex layout in JSON format.
 * Components of that layout can be accessed by their unique identifier (id).
 * The JSON defining the layout can be modified dynamically by the Scene's load
 * function.
 *
 * In the example, a Scene is created with a complex layout of
 * transforms and surfaces.
