/**
 * Transform
 * ---------
 *
 * A Famo.us Transform corresponds to a CSS3 3D transform.
 *
 * See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform
 *
 * With transforms you can affect the translation, rotation, scale, or skew of a
 * Famo.us renderable, e.g., a Famo.us Surface.
 *
 * Transforms are generally parameters to Famo.us modifiers which apply the
 * transform to its children.
 *
 * In this example, a Transform corresponding to a rotation of 45 degreees
 * is created and applied to a surface via a Famo.us Modifier.
 *
 * TODO: add example with a transitioning transform
