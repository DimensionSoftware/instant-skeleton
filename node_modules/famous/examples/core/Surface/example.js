/**
 * Surface
 * ---------
 *
 * A Famo.us Surface is loosely coupled to an HTML <div> on screen. A Surface
 * can take in any valid HTML as content.
 *
 * A popular question to ask is, when should I create multiple surfaces, versus
 * populating a single surface with more HTML content? The answer hinges on animating
 * content, versus static content. If your content is dynamically changing, create
 * a Surface for it. If your content is static (or rarely changing) HTML,
 * populate a Surface with it.
 *
 * In this example, a single surface with
 * some properties is set and add to the render tree.
