/**
 * InputSurface
 * ------------
 *
 * InputSurface is the same interface as a regular Surface
 * except that it will create an input tag instead of a
 * div tag.  It also exposes an interface for defining
 * input specific properites such as name, placeholder, value,
 * and type.
 *
 * In this example we have an InputSurface to insert
 * text.
