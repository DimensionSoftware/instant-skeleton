/**
 * ImageSurface
 * ------------
 *
 * ImageSurface is the same interface as a regular Surface
 * except that it will create an img tag instead of a
 * div tag.  When you call setContent on an ImageSurface,
 * it will change the src property of the tag.
 *
 * In this example we have an ImageSurface with the
 * Famo.us logo as it's content.
