Firing events on methods that get\ncalled many times (e.g. attaching to the Array.prototype) might lead to big performance\nhits and can quickly exceed the maximum call stack size.\n\n### Punching methods that throw\n\nMethods that throw instead of return will still call the after event handlers, with the error\nprovided as the result instead. This includes asynchronous functions with callbacks both before\nand after the callback occurs. These methods fire ``error`` and ``errorMethod`` events in place\nof the ``after`` and ``afterMethod`` events. Asynchronous methods that return an ``Error``\nobject as the first argument to the callback will also fire error-type events rather than after.\n\n### Strict punched methods\n\nA second optional parameter to `punch` (the third argument) is a flag indicating whether or not\nrubberduck should be strict with the signature of the resulting function. This means the ``length``\nproperty of any punched method will remain the same (rather than revert to zero), at the cost of\na slightly more expensive mechanism to punch the methods, and is off by default.\n\n## Changelog\n\n__1.0.0:__\n\n- Small internal reorganization\n- JSHint and code style improvements\n\n__0.x:__\n\n- Initial alpha releases\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 David Luecke daff@neyeon.de\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
