The function accepts 2 different arguments:\n\n1. A number which should be the port number or object with the configuration for\n   the servers.\n2. Optionally, an object with different callback methods.\n\nThe following properties can be configured:\n\n- **port**: The port number we should listen on. Also used to determine which\n  type of server we need to create.\n- **spdy**: Create SPDY server instead of a HTTPS server.\n- **root**: The root folder that contains your HTTPS certs.\n- **key, cert, ca, pfx, crl** Path or array of paths which will be read out the\n  correct files. The path should be relative to the **root** option.\n- **redirect**: Start up an optional HTTP server who will redirect users to the\n  port you're listening on. The supplied value should be the port number we need\n  to listen on.\n- **listen**: Do need to start listening to the server for you?\n\nThe following properties can be provided as callback object:\n\n- **close**: Server is closed.\n- **request**: Received a new incoming request.\n- **upgrade**: Received a HTTP upgrade request.\n- **listening**: We're now listening. Receives an optional error as first\n  argument.\n- **error**: Received a new error on the server.\n- **https**: A new HTTPS server has been created.\n- **http**: A new HTTP server has been created.\n- **spdy**: A new SPDY server has been created.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
