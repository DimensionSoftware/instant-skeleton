  "readme": "# env-variable\n\nA cross platform `env-variable` for browsers and node. Of course, browsers\ndoesn't have environment variables but we do have hashtags and localStorage\nwhich we will use as fallback.\n\n### hashtags\n\nThis is a really easy way of adding some trigger some environment variables that\nyou might use for debugging. We assume that the hashtag (#) contains\na query string who's key is the name and the value.. the value.\n\n### localStorage\n\nIf you want more persisting env variables you can set a query string of env\nvariables in localStorage. It will attempt to use the `env` variable.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis module is written for node and browserify and can be installed using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install --save env-variable\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis module exposes a node / `module.exports` interface. \n\n```js\nvar env = require('env-variable')();\n```\n\nAs you can see from the example above we execute the required module. You can\nalternately store it but I don't assume this a common pattern. When you execute\nthe function it returns an object with all the env variables. \n\nWhen you execute the function you can alternately pass it an object which will\nbe seen as the default env variables and all fallbacks and `process.env` will be\nmerged in to this object.\n\n```js\nvar env = require('env-variable')({\n  foo: 'bar',\n  NODE_ENV: 'production'\n});\n```\n\nOh, in `env-variable` we don't really care how you write your env variables. We\nautomatically add an extra lower case version of the variables so you can access\neverything in one consistent way.\n\nAnd that's basically everything you need to know. *random high fives*.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
